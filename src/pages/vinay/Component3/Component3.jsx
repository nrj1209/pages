          In the early 1980s we were in the process of building our house. Six months later, the builder told us he had to halt construction because there was a shortage of cement. We scoped the market but demand far outstripped supply and we had to stop construction for over three months.             </p>
          <p className='vinay-Component3-div2-text'>
          People say one of my strengths is ‘root-cause analysis’ and going beyond the obvious. I spent those three months understanding the reasons for the asymmetry between demand and supply; learning how cement is manufactured; and understanding the technology, processes, and logistics. I discovered Assam was a prime spot to manufacture cement. After six months of research, brainstorming, and due diligence, opportunity beckoned. The rest is history, Vinay Cements was born the following year.          </p>

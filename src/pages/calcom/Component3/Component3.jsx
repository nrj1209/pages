          After growing calcom Cements for over 15 years, we realized there was another dire shortage of cement in North-East India in the early 2000s. Infrastructural development was at an all-time high and cement prices were soaring because of the deficit in supply. Paradoxically the region still had a wealth of untapped raw materials. ​It was a rare opportunity to turn economic struggles into triumph and it sparked the inception of Calcom Cements​.          </p>
          <p className='calcom-Component3-div2-text'>
          The company is a manifestation of the founders ​visionary ​leadership, ​strategic ingenuity, and audacious risk-taking​. This was ​fortified by the​ir ​deep understanding of supply chain dynamics, a ​rich ​two-decade legacy in the cement industry, and over forty years of industrial acumen.​ ​​As a beacon of innovation ​Calcom ​reshaped industry benchmarks with an EBITDA that eclipses the industry average by 2.5 times. ​​​The company is a testament to the​ ​​founders' ​unyielding perseverance​ and hard work.          </p>
